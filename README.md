## Work Day Scheduler

## Description

A simple weekly calendar where users can add their daily tasks and plan their work days accordingly. In this webpage, users are able to add a task within a chosen timeblock between 9am-5pm, and have the option to save their tasks with the save button next to each time block provided. The time blocks have been color coded to indicate whether a certain task has passed, if a task is currently happening in the present time, or if it's been scheduled for a future event.
